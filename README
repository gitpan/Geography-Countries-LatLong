NAME
    Geography::Countries::LatLong - mean latitude and longitude

SYNOPSIS
            use Geography::Countries::LatLong;
            if ( Geography::Countries::LatLong::supports('Hungary') ){
                    my $array_ref    = latlong('Hungary');
                    my ($lat, $long) = latlongr('Hungary');
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides mean latitude and longitude for a large number of
    countries named in English.

    Regions and continents are not supported - please see the list below.

    Look-up is by the English name of the country, as returned by the
    "Geography::Countries" module, of which this is a sub-class that exports
    none of its parent's properties or methods.

    The mean values were arrived at with the following *MATLAB* code, where
    "name" is a country name recognised by *MATLAB*:

            function [lat,lon] = country_latlon(name);
              load worldmtx;
              c=worldhi(name);
              lat = mean(c.latlim);
              lon = mean(c.longlim);
              fprintf( '"%s" => ["%.4f","%.4f"],', name,lat,lon);
            % end function country_latlon

    You will need the Mapping Toolbox to run the above snippet.

            latlong

  latlong ($country_name)
    Returns as a 1x2 anonymous array the latitude and longitude for the
    country supplied as the sole argument, or "undef" if the country is not
    supported.

  supports ($country)
    Returns a true value if the sole argument is a country name supported by
    this module; otherwise, returns "undef".

  unsupported
    "warn"s to "STDERR" a list of "Geography::Countries::countries" that are
    not supported by this module.

  country
    Just "Geography::Countries"'s routine.
